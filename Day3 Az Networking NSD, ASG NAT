Network Security Groups:
        NSG's can contain multiple inbound and outbound security rules that enable you to filter traffic to 
and from resources by source and destination IP address, port, and protocol


*NSG can be attached to subnets, network cards or ASGS
*Various NSG properties:
    >Name
    >Priority
    >Source & Destination
    >Protocol
    >Direction
    >Port Range
    >Action

*Application Security Groups:
             Application security groups enable you to configure network security, allowing you to group virtual 
machines and define network security policies based on those groups

*ASGs can be set as Source or Destination in an NSG
*NSGs would still be required if the VMs are grouped together with ASGs
